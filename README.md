## ðŸŒ± About
I am **starting my journey in programming** and learning the **basics of computer science** through this textbook.  
Each chapter introduces new programming concepts, and at the end, it provides **hands-on challenges** to apply those ideas.  

This repository is my personal space to:
- Practice and reinforce the fundamentals of programming.
- Build confidence in solving problems using C++.
- Document my progress as I grow from beginner to more advanced topics.
